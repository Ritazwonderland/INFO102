    "Here, we have fun approximating pi by repeatedly throwing a coconut into a circle we inscribed in a square (using a vine we found on the beach). If the coconut throws are random, and we ignore throws that land outside the square, then the odds that a throw lands inside the circle are the ratio of the area of the circle divided by the area of the square, which equals pi/4. So we guess that pi is about 4 times our observed ratio."
